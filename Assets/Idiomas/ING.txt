01Good afternoon, son.
01Would you go get
01something for dinner
01at the store, please?
02Yup, got it.
02
02The store past the
02bridge, right?
03(My name is Axel, I'm
0319, and recently I've
03moved back to this
03country.)
03(I only left because
03we'd made ...
04... an investment
04somewhere else.)
04
04(All was good until
04there was some kind of
04intervention and...
05...um, Axel?
05
05Are you just gonna
05stand there or...?
06Uh- Of course not!
06
06(Anyways, guess that's
06a story for another
06time...)
07..Oh, I need $20 more,
07huh. (I'll just go get
07more back home.)
07
07Though, I'm a bit
07worried we don't ...
08... have enough, due
08to the situation...
09Oh, there's a flyer
09here. What's it for?
11...huh? The small
11print says... 
11ONE MILLION?!
11I need to go ask at
11that lab! Must be the
11one around.. uh, here
12...Um, hello. I'm Axel
12and I'm here for what
12this flyer says about
12testing...
12(Should also ask
12about the money thing)
13Ah, yes, you're in the
13right place. Here's
13the contract for it,
13in case you wanted the
13details.
14Oh, and yes, the
14money thing is true.
15Ah, thanks... um,
15wait, how'd you
15know what I was
15gonna ask?
16Well, I just felt you
16could've doubted that.
16
16
16(...It was written All
16over his face, too.)
17(Well, here it states
17the doctor will be
17responsible of all he
17tests on me, so what
17could go wrong?)
18Alright, if you want,
18you can start now with
18this medicine. It's
18pretty much harmless,
18so you shouldn't even
18feel a thing.
19What's more, you can
19take it with you to
19do your own testing.
19
19It's that safe!
20
20(You got the
20Medicine A).
20
20(Use it with "F").
21Good, thank you.
21(I feel something is
21off, he's responsible
21for what HE tests on
21me, though he did let
21me test...?)
22(...Nah, it's just
22me).
23Huh...? (I feel more..
23...agile?)
24(Now you can use the
24Medicine A to go
24faster).
25(Oh no. The bridge...
25Maybe I can find the
25way to get back with
25this... thing).
26(Wow, stuck the
26landing there.)
26(Is that a policeman,
26though?)
27(He saw me jump! I
27can't explain how I
27just did that...!
27Not like they'd
27believe me, I'll run!)
28(Phew, barely made it)
28Hey, mom. I couldn't
28get anything, I didn't
28have enough money.
29Oh, don't worry about
29it Axel. I'll figure
29this out.
30(Been a while since
30I last sawmy brother.
30Would be nice to talk
30to him.)
31Hey, Axel.
31*cough*
32Hey, are you OK?
32How was school today?
33I-I'm fine, though mom
33said I have a cold
33since earlier today,
33anyway.
34(Looks like more of a
34flu to me, odd...
34I'd better ask the
34doctor tomorrow.
