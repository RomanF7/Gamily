01Good afternoon, son.
01Would you go get
01something for dinner
01at the store, please?
02Yup, got it.
02
02The store past the
02bridge, right?
03(My name is Axel, I'm
0319, and recently I've
03moved back to this
03country.)
03(I only left because
03we'd made ...
04... an investment
04somewhere else.)
04
04(All was good until
04there was some kind of
04intervention and...
05...um, Axel?
05
05Are you just gonna
05stand there or...?
06Uh- Of course not!
06
06(Anyways, guess that's
06a story for another
06time...)
07..Oh, I need $21 more,
07huh. (I'll just go get
07more back home.)
07
07Though, I'm a bit
07worried we don't ...
08... have enough, due
08to the situation...
09Oh, there's a flyer
09here. What's it for?
11...huh? The small
11print says... 
11ONE MILLION?!
11I need to go ask at
11that lab! Must be the
11one around.. uh, here
12...Um, hello. I'm Axel
12and I'm here for what
12this flyer says about
12testing...
12(Should also ask
12about the money thing)
13Ah, yes, you're in the
13right place. Here's
13the contract for it,
13in case you wanted the
13details.
14Oh, and yes, the
14money thing is true.
15Ah, thanks... um,
15wait, how'd you
15know what I was
15gonna ask?
16Well, I just felt you
16could've doubted that.
16
16
16(...It was written All
16over his face, too.)
17(Well, here it states
17the doctor will be
17responsible of all he
17tests on me, so what
17could go wrong?)
18Alright, if you want,
18you can start now with
18this medicine. It's
18pretty much harmless,
18so you shouldn't even
18feel a thing.
19What's more, you can
19take it with you to
19do your own testing.
19
19It's that safe!
20
20(You got the
20Medicine A).
20
20(Use it with "F").
21Good, thank you.
21(I feel something is
21off, he's responsible
21for what HE tests on
21me, though he did let
21me test...?)
22(...Nah, it's just
22me).
23Huh...? (I feel more..
23...agile?)
24(Now you can use the
24Medicine A to go
24faster).
25(Oh no. The bridge...
25Maybe I can find the
25way to get back with
25this... thing).
26(Wow, stuck the
26landing there.)
26(Is that a policeman,
26though?)
27(He saw me jump! I
27can't explain how I
27just did that...!
27Not like they'd
27believe me, I'll run!)
28(Phew, barely made it)
28Hey, mom. I couldn't
28get anything, I didn't
28have enough money.
29Oh, don't worry about
29it Axel. I'll figure
29this out.
30(Been a while since
30I last saw my brother.
30Would be nice to talk
30to him.)
31Hey, Axel.
31*cough*
32Hey, are you OK?
32How was school today?
33I-I'm fine, though mom
33said I have a cold
33since earlier today,
33anyway.
34(Looks like more of a
34flu to me, odd...
34I'd better ask the
34doctor tomorrow.
35Well, it's 10 already.
35The lab must be open
35by now, I guess.
36(It'd be best if I
36go ask the doctor what
36is happening to my
36brother...)
37Hmm... Those symptoms,
37they sound peculiar.
37
37I feel like I've seen
37a case like this
37before... Ah!
38Well, I don't think
38it's anything to worry
38about, but this IS
38something new.
39Though I doubt that
39anything will happen
39your brother, we have
39to contain so 
39it dosnt spread.
40Im almost sure i have
40a cure under
40development, after all.
40this virus new.
41(Im still worried
41maybe I could ask him
41to use it on me.) 
42...The cure isnt fully
42tested, either way
42it could take even 
42months to be finished.
43Oh... Ok, do you have
43it stored here?
44I mean... yes.
44
44...Wait, it's not
44tested and it could--
45Oh-okay-not-thinkin-
45about-this-twice!
46...have very bad
46effects.
46
46..This can't end well.
47...Hmm. I feel exactly
47the same, this time I
47don't feel different
47compared to the other
47medicine...
48Maybe it just...
48takes... longer...?
49...ugh, where am I?
50And what even is
50all of this?
51Hey, what-
52Before you ask, you're
52inside your ownbody.
53Oh.
53
53...huh?
54It might sound weird,
54but it looks like it's
54the effects of the
54medicine.
54I told you it wasn't
54fully developed.
55So it.. teleported me?
55It doesn't take the
55weird factor out of
55this...
56Try not to harm any of
56these creatures, they
56are just protecting
56your body.
57They just dont
57identify you, so you
57should try to just
57avoid them.
58That's unfortunate.
58I just want to go
58back home!
59Just keep going.
59You might find the
59exit just ahead.
60Medicines have a very
60different use here.
60You can make slow time
60or even fully stop it.
61(So the blue one
61should slow down time?
61
61I'm sure that time
61will freeze if I use
61both at the same time)
62Also, take this.
63A bar of soap?
64I had the feeling it
64could come handy.
65(...)
65(...great, doubt I
65have a use for this.)
66I'd better get going.
68"     CONTROLS
68 F - Makes you faster.
68 G - Slows time.
68 F+G - Stops Time."
69"With a joystick, use
69 X or Y."
70(A what-stick?)
71How did you get over
71here that fast?
72Less questions, more
72action.
72
72I just found the exit,
72just go through this
72huge, not-scary hole.
73Though, you may find
73something that's NOT a
73part of you.
73Be careful.
74Oh.
74
74...On my way!
75How enthusiastic...
76...I have a feeling
76whatever it is, it's
76not friendly to me...
77...I can't...make any
77sense out of this! How
77should I defeat it?
78(You remember the bar
78of soap in your pocket
78and take it out.)
79...Wow, that almost
79worked!
80The box says it kills
80	 99.9%
80     of germs.
80This has to be a joke.
81Either way, I could
81even step on it.
81No big deal.
82(!!)
83Hey you, you're
83finally awake.
84Huh...what's going on?
85You just took one of
85the medicines I'm
85testing and went
85unconscious, but
85I've made progress.
86W-what does that mean?
87I finished developing
87the medicine by doing
87a few studies.
88If you wanted to make
88it faster you should
88have said it
89No thanks.
90Whatever i told your
90family about your
90situation.
91We even got money for
91the tests you did!
92Wait, really??
93Oh, right. The most
93important thing I was
93going to 
94I see.
94(Should've told me
94that before...)
95So, everything that
95I did there just now,
95what about that?
96I don't know what you
96are talking about.
97(Was it all a dream?
97Why do I bother...)
98Well, we did get what
98we needed!
